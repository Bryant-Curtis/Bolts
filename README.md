## Story

There once was an infant Water God, Sui, and an infant Thunder god, Rai, who both grew up without parents. Often seeing each other as rivals, they competed in all things to see who was the better. Rai was faster at learning and always picked up on new skills faster than Sui. Sui learned fluidly as well, and put in the extra effort to keep up with his rival. However one day, Rai who due to his excellent speed in learning, became very powerful and decided he wanted to rule their kingdom. However, Sui also had plans for the kingdom and wasn't about to let his life-long rival take the role. Rai decides it's time to use his lightning powers to take out his best-friend from childhood. Sui, does not hold the immediate power Rai does, but is secretly able to store up power in the ground that is greater than Rai's. However in order to store it, <strong>he must stay attached to the ground.</strong> Fortunately, he has learned how to slide using water spells, enabling him to move without leaving the ground. Being slower in learning, he has not yet learned how to stop quickly and <strong>takes time to slow down</strong> to move in another direction.

Will Sui be able to store up enough energy to defeat his childhood friend, and change him from his ways? Or will Rai defeat Sui and cause havoc to the kingdom?
