<!-- <h2>Story</h2> -->

<h2>Description</h2>

This is a dodge-or-die browser game. The user can move left or right to dodge Bolts of lightning falling
at various incrementing speeds from the sky.
<!-- There is a story behind the deadly scene. For those interested please see the Story section below. -->
It is hosted online and can be played anytime as a pass-time or even used for competitions with
friends. The player with the highest score or highest number of bolts survived is the winner. Counting by
number of Bolts is more difficult in my opinion.

<h2>GamePlay</h2>

<strong>You are the blue player</strong> in the middle of the screen on the ground(at the bottom of the screen).</br>
Yellow Bolts of lightning will <strong>fall down</strong> on you at various and <strong>incrementing speeds</strong> from the sky (top of the screen).</br>
You have <strong>3 lives</strong> that will deteriorate by 1 each time a bolt strikes you.</br>
<strong>You have a score</strong> that will increment for as long as your life count is greater than 0.</br>
Use the <strong>"LEFT"</strong> and <strong>"RIGHT" arrow keys</strong> on the keyboard to move your player to dodge the falling bolts.</br>
After you have been <strong>struck 3 times</strong>, you will <strong>EXPLODE</strong> so... beware!</br>

<strong>Note:</strong> The movement of the player is very fluid, so beware! He is made of water and hence slides rather than walks.
But if you can control him right he can prove to be useful to you.
<!-- The reason for this comes from the details in the Story, if you choose to read it. -->
