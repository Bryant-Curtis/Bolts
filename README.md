<i>Fun</i> <strong>Short Easy Game</strong>: [Play Here][Bolts]

Bolts are striking from the sky in a crazy storm... You are a blob of water, dodging the cascading bolts as the storm increases in intensity. Being made of water, your movements are fluid and you don't move nor stop immediately. How long will you survive this onslaught of falling electricity?
