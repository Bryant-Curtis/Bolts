<h2>GamePlay</h2>

<strong>You are the blue player</strong> in the middle of the screen on the ground(at the bottom of the screen).</br>
Yellow Bolts of lightning will <strong>fall down</strong> on you at various and <strong>incrementing speeds</strong> from the sky (top of the screen).</br>
You have 3 lives that will deteriorate by 1 each time a bolt strikes you.</br>
You have a score that will increment for as long as your life count is greater than 0.</br>
Use the "LEFT" and "RIGHT" arrow keys on the keyboard to move your player to dodge the falling bolts.</br>
After you have been struck 3 times, you will <strong>EXPLODE</strong> so... beware!</br>

Catch: The movement of the player is very fluid, so beware! The reason for this comes from the details
in the Story, if you choose to read it.
